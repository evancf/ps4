# EEB 338/538 Analysis and Visualization of Biological Data
# Problem Set 4

#1a Load the iris data from R's datasets

#b Extract the observations of species "setosa" into their own dataframe; repeat for "virginica"

#c Examine histograms of sepal length and sepal width for setosa

#d Test whether we can reject the null hypothesis that setosa sepal length and sepal width are each normally distributed 

# e TRUE or FALSE? Can we conclude that setosa sepal length and sepal length are normally distributed?

#f Why?


#2a Model setosa sepal width as a constant

#b How else can the value of the intercept be estimated?


#3a Now model petal lengths as a function of sepal length in a model called m

#b Examine a summary of the model

#c What proportion of the variance is explained by the model?

#d TRUE or FALSE? Does this model outperform a model without any covariates?

#e TRUE or FALSE? Is the effect of sepal length significant at alpha = 0.1?

#f TRUE or FALSE? Is the effect of sepal length at alpha = 0.05?

#g TRUE or FALSE? Is the effect of sepal length at alpha = 0.01?


#4a What is the null expectation for the intercept estimate?

#b Based on the p-value, do we reject the null hypothesis?


#5a Present results of the model in the form of a scatterplot of Iris setosa sepal width ~ sepal length

#b Use purple filled triangles for points

#c Change the axis labels to more readable text

#d Add a regression line of best fit that is purple and dashed.

#e Add text to the upper left corner displaying the coefficient of variation (i.e., proportion of variance explained by model)

#f Add text to the upper left corder displaying the significant value of the beta coefficient


#6a Visually examine the relationship between Iris virginica petal length and petal width

#b Model the mean of Iris virginica petal width as a constant and examine a summary of the model

#c Now model Iris virginica pedal width as a function of petal length

#d To what extent does the model with petal length as a predictor explain the variance in the data?

#e TRUE or FALSE? Would you conclude that more simple model of petal width as a constant is a better model when alpha = 0.05?

#f What information did you use to make your decision?

#g Add the regression line of best fit to the plot of the relationship between petal width and petal length


#7a Check for homoscedasticity of errors

#b Is this assumption met? Why or why not?

#c Check assumptions of additivity and linearity

#d Is this assumption met? Why or why not?
